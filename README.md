## 🔍 Core Insights
- 📈 **Pricing matters**: Lower pricing didn’t always boost sales; some premium pricing led to higher overall revenue in select categories.
- 🧺 **Product categories** like denim and casualwear consistently outperformed others, especially during specific quarters.
- 📦 **Stock mismatches** led to missed revenue opportunities—demand prediction models flagged several such events.
- 🧑‍💼 **Customer behavior** revealed that younger adult customers had high conversion, but mid-age groups had greater cart value.
